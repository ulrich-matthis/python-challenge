# python-challenge README

## NOTE TO READER ## 
  The python scripts may encounter errors when ran outside of the resource file; however, identical scripts have been placed within the resource folders and they both run nominally from that location

Summary of each folder

For PyPoll:
  The goal of the PyPoll assignment was to analyze an election from a csv file to determine the total votes cast, vote tally for each candidate and have the script announce the winner below the vote tallys. The script also created a .txt file that matched the output from the terminal which was saved to an analysis folder within the PyPoll folder.
  
For PyBank:
  The goal of the PyBank assignment was to analyze a list of financial data and determine the total amount of profit, greatest increase in finances, greatest decrease in finances, the average month-to-month change in the finances and the total month count for the data set. For greatest increase and decrease it was also necessary to list the Month-Year of each of those instances in the data. The script also had to export a .txt file that matched the output from the terminal to an analysis folder within the PyBank folder.
